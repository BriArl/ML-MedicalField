# ML-MedicalField

Welcome to the Machine Learning in Healthcare repository! This project showcases the application of machine learning techniques to healthcare data analysis through two informative demos.

# Demo 1: Predicting Blood Pressure with Regression
In this demo, I delve into the world of regression models applied to healthcare data. I use a dataset comprising various health indicators to predict blood pressure levels. Through a step-by-step process, we explore data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation. The goal is to demonstrate how regression techniques can provide insights into predicting blood pressure trends.

# Demo 2: Predicting Liver Disease via Classification
The second demo focuses on classification tasks in healthcare data analysis. I work with a dataset containing relevant health indicators to predict the presence or absence of liver disease. By navigating through data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and performance assessment, I aim to illustrate how classification methods can aid in identifying potential cases of liver disease.
